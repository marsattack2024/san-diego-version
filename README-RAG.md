# Supabase Vector Embedding RAG Implementation

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Supabase vector embeddings and the Vercel AI SDK. The implementation allows the chatbot to search for relevant information in a vector database and use it to generate more accurate responses.

## What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models by providing them with relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base. This approach:

1. Takes a user query and converts it to a vector embedding
2. Searches a vector database for semantically similar content
3. Retrieves the most relevant documents
4. Provides these documents as context to the LLM
5. Generates a response based on both the query and the retrieved context

## Project Structure

```
/utils
  /vector
    embeddings.ts          # Create embeddings and manage vector operations
    documentRetrieval.ts   # Query similar documents from Supabase
    formatters.ts          # Format retrieved documents for various use cases

/types
  vector.ts                # Type definitions for vector operations

/app/api
  /vector-search
    route.ts               # API endpoint for standalone vector searches

/components/chat
  vector-search-toggle.tsx  # Toggle to enable/disable vector search

/agents/tools
  vector-search-tool.ts     # AI SDK tool for vector search capabilities
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Vector Functionality ✅
- ✅ Implement embedding generation
- ✅ Create document retrieval utilities
- ✅ Add type definitions
- ✅ Create vector search API endpoint

### Phase 2: AI Tool Integration ✅
- ✅ Implement vector search tool for AI SDK
- ✅ Integrate with chat API route
- ✅ Update agent system prompts
- ✅ Add vector search to default agent tools

### Phase 3: UI Integration ✅
- ✅ Integrate vector search seamlessly without requiring user action
- ✅ Make vector search available to all agents
- ✅ Ensure consistent response formatting

### Phase 4: Optimization ✅
- ✅ Set similarity threshold to 0.5 for better results
- ✅ Add query preprocessing to improve match quality
- ✅ Implement automatic fallback to lower thresholds when no results
- ✅ Add comprehensive performance monitoring
- ✅ Optimize vector search performance

## How It Works

1. When a user asks a question, their query is converted to a vector embedding
2. This embedding is compared to document embeddings stored in Supabase
3. The most similar documents are retrieved based on cosine similarity
4. These documents are formatted and provided as context to the LLM
5. The LLM generates a response using both the query and the retrieved context

## Key Features

- Semantic search using vector embeddings
- Integration with existing chat interface
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Configurable similarity thresholds and result limits
- Query preprocessing for improved match quality
- Automatic fallback to lower thresholds when no results found
- Detailed performance metrics and slow query detection

## Current Status

Phase 4 implementation completed:

- Set default similarity threshold to 0.5 for better balance of precision and recall
- Implemented query preprocessing to improve match quality by removing filler words
- Added automatic fallback to lower thresholds when no results are found
- Implemented comprehensive performance monitoring with metrics
- Added slow query detection and logging
- Optimized vector search performance with better error handling

The RAG implementation is now complete and ready for production use. The system seamlessly integrates vector search capabilities into the existing chat interface, providing enhanced responses based on the knowledge base without requiring explicit user action.
