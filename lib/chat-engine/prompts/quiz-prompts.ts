d. When they start walking
Statement:
The perfect time to schedule a newborn photography session is when your baby is between 5 to 14 days old.

We can work with babies up to three months old.

a. The minute you find out you're pregnant
b. Around 28 to 36 weeks of pregnancy
c. When the baby is ready to come out

Quiz Example #6:

Question 1:
When should I schedule newborn photos?
a. After my baby is born
b. When I get close to my due date
c. In the 2nd trimester
Statement:
The best time to schedule newborn photos is during your pregnancy, ideally in the second trimester. This will allow you to secure a spot on our schedule and ensures that we have plenty of time to plan for your session. Because of the uncertainty of due dates, we only accept 10 newborn sessions per month!
It's important to keep in mind that newborn photography is typically done within the first two weeks of the baby's life, so scheduling ahead of time will also ensure that you can get on our calendar during that narrow window. By scheduling your newborn photos in advance, you can relax and enjoy those first few weeks with your new baby, knowing that you have already taken care of an important milestone in your child's life.

Question 2:
What makes maternity photos different from other photography sessions?
a. Every pregnancy is unique
b. We do more photo retouching
c. Posing takes more creativity
d. All of the above
Statement:
Maternity sessions capture a unique and fleeting moment in your life—the time when you are growing a new life, a child with whom you will have an unbreakable bond. Maternity photography celebrates the beauty and strength of motherhood and documents the earliest moments of a relationship that will last a lifetime.
Pregnancy is a special time filled with anticipation and excitement, and maternity sessions aim to capture that feeling. These sessions are highly personalized and focus on your individual style, personality, and the connection you share with your child.
Additionally, maternity photography is often done in a more intimate and private setting than other types of photography. The goal is to capture the beauty of your body during pregnancy, and that involves a lot more thought and creativity in posing. Every woman's experience will be different because every body is unique and beautiful in its own way.

Question 3:
Will you edit out flaws/blemishes in my photos?
a. We edit out every little imperfection
b. We don't do any retouching
c. It depends on what you want us to do
Statement:
We understand that temporary blemishes like pimples, cuts, and bruises can be a concern for some clients, especially during maternity or newborn sessions. That's why we take the time to carefully edit our photos to remove these "imperfections," ensuring that you look your best in your final images.
We also know that everyone has their own unique preferences and personal style, and we are happy to accommodate any specific editing requests you may have. Some of our clients love to show their stretch marks, scars, or natural skin, while others may want those edited out. We are more than happy to work with you to create photos that reflect your individual beauty and vision.

Question 4:
How long do newborn sessions take?
a. 30-60 minutes
b. 60-90 minutes
c. 90-120 minutes
Statement:
Newborn sessions typically take one to two hours (sometimes a little more), depending on your baby's mood during the session. As newborns are unpredictable and can have varying levels of comfort and temperament, it's essential to approach each session with flexibility and patience.
Some babies might be sleepy and content, while others may be fussier and require more time and attention to get the perfect shots. Additionally, we understand that newborns can have unique needs and routines, so we try to work around their schedule to ensure that they are comfortable and happy throughout the session!
Our goal is to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for both baby and parents, allowing us to capture the most natural and beautiful moments. We encourage parents to bring any items that will help soothe their baby, such as a favorite blanket or pacifier, to make the experience as stress-free as possible.

Quiz Example #7:

Question 1:
You just found out that you are expecting! Congratulations! I bet you are beginning to think about scheduling your maternity and newborn photography sessions. You might be wondering when you should book these sessions. After all, if you're not entirely sure when you will begin showing or when the baby will arrive, when should you book the sessions?
a. After the baby is born
b. As early as the second trimester
c. At the beginning of the third trimester
d. Two weeks after the baby is born
Statement:
The sooner the better!
The best time frame for a maternity photography session is between 28 and 36 weeks. However, mamas-to-be can schedule sessions beyond 36 weeks as long as the session is not too close to the delivery date and they can still move around with their growing baby bump.
I also recommend scheduling your baby's newborn session during the second trimester of pregnancy. At that time, I will tentatively set a date for the session, which will be approximately 1 to 15 days after the baby's expected due date.

Question 2:
It's that time of year when you are starting to think about scheduling your family's portrait session. Last year, your session was in a studio and this year you would like the session to be outdoors. What time of day is best for an outdoor family portrait session?
a. Afternoon
b. Morning
c. Golden hour
d. Evening
Statement:
You got it, the golden hour is the best time of day for an outdoor session!
The golden hour refers to the hour just after the sun has risen or the hour before the sun sets. During the golden hour, lighting is ideal because the sun is typically at its lowest point in the sky. As a result, the light is soft and diffused, which creates less contrast and shadows. Additionally, during these hours there are fewer people out and about. This gives us the extra bonus of not having to worry about anyone walking in the background or distracting your family during the session. The glow of the sun at this time will also help add dimension to the background and allow for more detail to come through the images.

Question 3:
It is a week before your little one's newborn session and you are so excited! Your baby is doing amazing on their schedule and sleeping nearly 3 hours at a time (you sure are lucky!). You live about 45 minutes from the studio and you are worried about feeding the baby the morning of the session. What is the best option for feeding the baby the morning of the session?
a. Feed the baby as soon as you arrive at the studio
b. Feed the baby while driving to the studio (with someone else driving, of course!)
c. Feed the baby immediately before leaving home
d. Feed the baby an hour after arriving at the studio
Statement:
What's cuter than a milk-drunk infant? (Hint: the answer is nothing!).
Newborns are some of the hungriest creatures on the planet. You don't want their session disrupted by their frantic cries for milk. Feeding and burping your baby right before their newborn session begins means less crying, better sleep, and relaxed parents (and photographer!).
Avoid giving them a full meal one to two hours before the session. If the baby seems hungry, try to give them a small snack to get them through until the session begins. Then, slightly before your session, you can feed them a full meal and expect a happy, tired baby in return.
Most sessions last 3-4 hours, which leaves plenty of time to refuel if your baby wakes up hungry. Just make sure to have many extra bottles on hand (or mama)!

Question 4:
You've booked your family's annual portrait session! Now, you are starting to think about what to wear. What is the #1 rule to follow when planning outfits for your family portrait session?
a. Say no to characters
b. Coordinate, don't match
c. Subtly mix in textures and patterns
d. Trick question, all of the above!
Statement:
Did we trick you!?
When planning your family's portrait session, we highly recommend the following:
Coordinate, don't match: The idea is to choose a color palette of three or four complementary colors, and then dress the family in shades of that palette. Start with one statement piece that has a classic pattern—often mom's outfit—and then pick out clothing for the rest of the family that draws from the colors in that outfit. Alternatively, keep the color palette neutral (think grays, browns, creams), and introduce a pop of color here and there.
Say no to characters and logos: Especially for the kiddos. As much as they may love their Paw Patrol shirt, it is a distracting element in a photo. The star of the show should be the people in your family—not the logo or words on a shirt.
Shop at the same store: Stores usually have collections of clothing that are released seasonally, already coordinated, making it super easy to style everyone in the family.
Subtly mix in patterns and texture: Feel free to mix in a couple of different patterns and textures to add some more dimension and character!

Question 5:
It's been about a week since your session and your images are ready to view! What is the BEST option for displaying the new exquisite images of your loved ones?
a. Use one of the images as my Facebook profile picture
b. Print the images at Walgreens and put them in a photo album
c. Save the images to the computer
d. Custom wall art and luxury albums
Statement:
Always say yes to custom wall art and luxury albums!
I am a big believer in decorating our homes with artwork of the ones that we love. After my grandmother passed away, I was going through old family photos searching for an image of me and my grandmother. After several hours, I realized I had not taken (let alone printed and displayed) a picture of us together. I was heartbroken. Since that evening, I have made it my mission to educate my clients on the importance of having high-quality photographic artwork created and displayed in their homes of the ones they love. That is why all my clients have personalized ordering appointments. I love helping my clients create gorgeous wall art displays for their homes that will be cherished for generations.
