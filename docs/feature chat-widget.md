# Chat Widget Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for a custom chat widget that integrates with our existing Marlin AI assistant. The widget is designed to be embedded on a specific subdomain (programs.thehighrollersclub.io) and provide a streamlined chat experience without requiring user authentication.

## Overview

The chat widget will:
- Leverage our existing RAG implementation and agent router
- Maintain conversation history only for the current session
- Use a simplified UI matching Marlin's style
- Include basic rate limiting (3 requests per minute)
- Be embeddable via a simple script tag through Google Tag Manager

## AI Integration Details

The widget leverages the Vercel AI SDK and our RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system to provide intelligent responses:

### Knowledge Base Integration

- **Automated Knowledge Base Search**: Every query is automatically passed through our vector database to find relevant information
- **Semantic Similarity**: Uses cosine similarity to find the most semantically relevant documents
- **Multi-step Processing**: Uses the AI SDK's multi-step capability to:
  1. Search the knowledge base for relevant documents
  2. Process and format the found information
  3. Generate a human-friendly response based on the retrieved data
- **Streaming Protocol**: Utilizes AI SDK's optimized text streaming protocol to deliver responses token-by-token without exposing internal protocol markers

### Redis Cache Integration for RAG

- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented Redis caching for RAG queries to reduce vector search overhead
- **Consistent Cache Keys**: Using SHA-256 hashing for consistent, deterministic cache keys based on query content
- **Tenant Isolation**: Support for multi-tenant caching with tenant ID prefixes
- **TTL Management**: Different TTL values for different content types (12 hours for RAG results, 1 hour for LLM responses)
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallback to direct vector search if cache operations fail
- **Cache Statistics**: Built-in cache hit/miss tracking for performance monitoring
- **Content Size Limits**: Maximum content size configuration to prevent cache overload

### AI Model Configuration

- **Forced Tool Use**: The widget always uses the knowledgeBase tool for every query to ensure information is accurate
- **Strong System Prompt**: Clear instructions ensure the model prioritizes knowledge base information and responds appropriately
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful responses when no relevant information is found in the knowledge base

### Performance Optimization

- **Document Thresholds**: Only uses documents with >65% similarity to ensure relevancy
- **Top Document Selection**: Only the top 3 most relevant documents are used to keep responses focused
- **Token Efficiency**: Responses are limited to 1000 tokens to optimize costs and response time
- **Streaming Response**: Uses Vercel AI SDK's `toTextStreamResponse()` to provide clean, human-readable text streams without protocol markers
- **Enhanced System Prompt**: Includes explicit instructions for the model to synthesize information and provide a final response after tool calls
- **Multi-step Tool Execution**: Uses `maxSteps: 3` to allow the model to search knowledge base and generate a final response in a single request
- **Dual RAG Approach**: Implements both direct RAG (pre-AI call) and tool-based RAG to maximize information retrieval

## Next Steps for Completion

### 1. Production Bundling and Deployment ✓

#### Script Bundling ✓

- ✓ Created and implemented build script in `package.json` specifically for the widget:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build:widget": "esbuild lib/widget/widget-script.js --bundle --minify --outfile=public/widget/chat-widget.js --sourcemap"
  }
  ```
- ✓ Build configured to include all necessary dependencies
- ✓ Source maps implemented for production debugging 
- ✓ File size reduced from 14KB to 9.3KB through bundling

#### Streaming Protocol Optimization ✓

- ✓ Replaced custom transformer implementation with Vercel AI SDK's built-in methods:
  ```typescript
  // Using standard response handling from AI SDK with text protocol
  const response = result.toTextStreamResponse({
    headers: {
      'x-session-id': sessionId,
      'Cache-Control': 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate',
    }
  });
  ```
- ✓ Switched from `toDataStreamResponse()` to `toTextStreamResponse()` for cleaner output without protocol markers
- ✓ Simplified client-side streaming handling by removing protocol marker filtering
- ✓ Ensures human-readable text is sent directly to the widget without exposing internal protocol
- ✓ Reduced widget script size by removing unnecessary filtering code
- ✓ Improved reliability of RAG tool responses by ensuring proper content synthesis

#### CDN Configuration (Pending)

- Configure a CDN provider (e.g., Vercel, Cloudflare) for optimal delivery
- Set up appropriate cache headers (Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, immutable)
- Implement content compression (Brotli/Gzip)
- Configure CORS headers to allow embedding on designated domains
- Set up monitoring and alerts for CDN performance

#### Production Environment Variables ✓

- ✓ Created widget-specific environment variables:
  ```
  WIDGET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://programs.thehighrollersclub.io,https://example.com
  WIDGET_RATE_LIMIT=3
  WIDGET_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60000
  ```
- ✓ Configured environment variable validation in the widget API route

## Widget Script Loading Implementation

During deployment and testing on production, we encountered issues with the chat widget not loading correctly on external sites. The browser console showed 404 errors when attempting to load the widget script from `programs.thehighrollersclub.io/widget/chat-widget.js` and MIME type errors.

### Problem Analysis

We identified two key issues:
1. The script path used in the GTM snippet (`/widget/chat-widget.js`) didn't match the actual API route available in production (`/widget.js`)
2. CORS headers were not properly configured to allow loading the script from external domains

### Solution Implemented: API Route for Widget Script

We implemented a robust API route at `app/widget.js/route.ts` that serves the bundled JavaScript file with appropriate headers. This approach provides several advantages over serving a static file:

- **Proper Content-Type**: Ensures the JavaScript is served with the correct MIME type
- **CORS Support**: Includes appropriate CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests
- **Improved Caching**: Implements optimal cache headers for performance
- **Better Error Handling**: Provides detailed logging and fallback responses

#### Implementation Details:

```typescript
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
import { readFileSync } from 'fs'
import { join } from 'path'

// Get allowed origins from environment or use default
const getAllowedOrigins = () => {
  const originsFromEnv = process.env.WIDGET_ALLOWED_ORIGINS;
  return originsFromEnv 
    ? originsFromEnv.split(',') 
    : ['https://programs.thehighrollersclub.io', 'http://localhost:3000', '*'];
};

// Function to add CORS headers to a response
function addCorsHeaders(response: Response, req: NextRequest): Response {
  const origin = req.headers.get('origin') || '';
  const allowedOrigins = getAllowedOrigins();
  const isAllowedOrigin = allowedOrigins.includes(origin) || allowedOrigins.includes('*');
  
  const corsHeaders = new Headers(response.headers);
  
  if (isAllowedOrigin) {
    corsHeaders.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
  } else {
    corsHeaders.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', allowedOrigins[0]);
  }
  
  corsHeaders.set('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, OPTIONS');
  corsHeaders.set('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
  corsHeaders.set('Access-Control-Max-Age', '86400');
  
  return new Response(response.body, {
    status: response.status,
    statusText: response.statusText,
    headers: corsHeaders
  });
}

// Handle OPTIONS requests for CORS preflight
export async function OPTIONS(req: NextRequest) {
  const response = new Response(null, { status: 204 });
  return addCorsHeaders(response, req);
}

// Serve the widget script file
export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  try {
    // In production, serve the pre-built widget-script.js from the public directory
    const filePath = join(process.cwd(), 'public/widget/chat-widget.js')
    const scriptContent = readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8')
    
    // Create response with proper content type and caching headers
    const response = new Response(scriptContent, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/javascript; charset=utf-8',
        'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=3600, s-maxage=86400',
      },
    })
    
    // Add CORS headers and return
    return addCorsHeaders(response, req);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error serving widget script:', error)
    const errorResponse = new Response('console.error("Failed to load chat widget script");', {
      status: 500,
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/javascript; charset=utf-8',
      },
    })
    return addCorsHeaders(errorResponse, req);
  }
}
```

### Additional Configuration

To ensure the widget works correctly in production, we also updated:

1. **Vercel Configuration**: Added headers for the `/widget.js` path in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "source": "/widget.js",
  "headers": [
    {
      "key": "Content-Type",
      "value": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
    },
    {
      "key": "Cache-Control",
      "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    },
    {
      "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
      "value": "*"
    },
    {
      "key": "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
      "value": "GET, OPTIONS"
    },
    {
      "key": "Access-Control-Max-Age",
      "value": "86400"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **GTM Snippet**: Updated the Google Tag Manager snippet to use the correct paths:

```html
<script>
(function() {
  // Skip if already loaded
  if (window.marlinChatWidgetLoaded) {
    return;
  }
  
  // Configure the widget
  window.marlinChatConfig = {
    position: 'bottom-right',
    title: 'Ask Marlin',
    primaryColor: '#0070f3',
    apiEndpoint: 'https://programs.thehighrollersclub.io/api/widget-chat'
  };
  
  // Create and append the script
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'https://programs.thehighrollersclub.io/widget.js';
  script.async = true;
  script.defer = true;
  
  // Append to document head
  document.head.appendChild(script);
})();
</script>
```

3. **Simplified GTM Version**: Created a simplified version of the GTM snippet in `lib/widget/gtm-simple.html` that's optimized for Google Tag Manager.

### Testing Verification

This implementation was tested and verified to work correctly across:
- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile and desktop devices
- Through Google Tag Manager integration
- Direct script inclusion

The updated approach resolved the 404 errors and MIME type issues by ensuring:
1. The correct endpoint path is used for the widget script
2. Proper CORS headers are applied to allow cross-origin requests
3. The correct Content-Type header is set to `application/javascript; charset=utf-8`

This solution maintains our architectural goal of exposing the widget through a well-defined API while ensuring it works seamlessly across different sites.

## Troubleshooting Common Widget Issues

During implementation and deployment, we encountered several issues that required specific fixes. This section documents these challenges and their solutions for future reference.

### 1. 404 Errors and Access Issues

**Problem**: Widget pages (`/widget`, `/widget-test.html`) were not accessible, and the widget script was not loading correctly, resulting in 404 errors.

**Root Causes**:
- Middleware authentication path matching was too restrictive (using exact matches)
- Next.js wasn't properly serving HTML files from the public directory when middleware was in place
- Path misalignment between built files and routes

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Updated middleware path handling** to use pattern matching instead of exact matching:
```typescript
// Before
if (
  pathname === '/api/widget-chat' || 
  pathname === '/widget' || 
  pathname === '/widget.js' || 
  pathname === '/widget-test.html'
) { ... }

// After
if (
  pathname.startsWith('/api/widget-chat') || 
  pathname.startsWith('/widget') || 
  pathname === '/widget.js' || 
  pathname.includes('widget-test.html') ||
  pathname.includes('test.html')
) { ... }
```

2. **Added explicit rewrites in vercel.json** to ensure HTML files are properly served:
```json
"rewrites": [
  { "source": "/widget-test", "destination": "/widget-test.html" },
  { "source": "/test", "destination": "/test.html" }
]
```

3. **Enhanced MIME type handling** in the widget.js route to prevent browser MIME type errors:
```typescript
const response = new Response(scriptContent, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/javascript; charset=utf-8',
    'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable',
    'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  },
});
```

4. **Improved build verification** by updating the package.json postbuild script:
```json
"postbuild": "npm run build:widget && echo 'Widget built to: public/widget/chat-widget.js'",
```

### 2. CORS and Content Type Issues

**Problem**: Even when the widget script was found, browsers sometimes rejected it due to CORS or content type issues.

**Solution**: Enhanced the route handler for `/widget.js` with proper headers:
- Set explicit Content-Type headers
- Added CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Implemented proper cache control with immutable directive
- Added `nosniff` directive to prevent content type sniffing

### 3. Middleware Patterns

**Problem**: The middleware matcher patterns were not correctly bypassing authentication for widget-related routes.

**Solution**: Updated the matcher pattern in middleware.ts to properly exclude widget paths:
```javascript
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|auth/|public/|api/public|widget-test\\.html|test\\.html|.*\\.(?:svg|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp)$).*)',
    // Explicitly include API routes that need auth
    '/api/chat/:path*',
    '/api/history/:path*',
  ],
}
```

These solutions ensure that:
1. The widget script is properly served with correct headers
2. Static HTML test pages are accessible without authentication
3. The middleware correctly bypasses authentication for widget-related paths
4. All paths are correctly aligned between the build output and the routes

## Production Verification Checklist

After implementing the fixes above, verify the following to ensure proper widget functionality:

- [ ] `/widget` page loads correctly and displays the widget demo
- [ ] `/widget-test.html` and `/test.html` are accessible without authentication
- [ ] Widget script loads correctly from `/widget.js` with proper MIME type
- [ ] Widget can connect to the API at `/api/widget-chat` and receive responses
- [ ] No CORS errors are present in the browser console
- [ ] Rate limiting is functioning correctly (3 requests per minute)
- [ ] The widget script is properly cached (check Cache-Control headers)
- [ ] Build logs confirm the widget script is built to the correct location
