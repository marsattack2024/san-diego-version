Should They Have a Standardized Structure/Parent File? Maybe, but likely less structured than the tests.

Less Need for Rigidity: Unlike tests where you have many files testing different units often needing the same mocks and helpers, operational scripts usually perform more distinct, standalone tasks. There's often less shared logic between deploy-vercel.js and make-admin.js, for example.
Potential Shared Logic (scripts/lib/): You can still apply a similar pattern for shared utilities specific to these operational scripts. Looking at your list:
load-env.ts: This looks like a prime candidate to live in a scripts/lib/ subfolder, as other scripts (check-env.ts, setup-env.ts, dev.js?) might use it.
Supabase Script Utilities: If make-admin.js and setup-supabase.js need to connect to Supabase (perhaps with admin privileges different from your app's user-facing client), you could create a shared helper in scripts/lib/supabase-script-utils.ts to handle that connection logic.
No Single "Parent File": It's generally not common to have a single "parent" script that orchestrates all others unless you're building a dedicated command-line interface (CLI) tool. Usually, these scripts are run individually as needed (e.g., node scripts/make-admin.js or via package.json scripts like "deploy": "node scripts/deploy-vercel.js").
Focus on Clarity: Often, the best way to "streamline" operational scripts is through:
Clear Naming: Ensure filenames clearly state the script's purpose.
Good Documentation: Maintain a scripts/README.md that explains what each script does, how to run it, and any required environment variables or arguments.
Recommendation for scripts/ Folder:

Cleanup: Definitely delete the scripts/tests/ subdirectory and any individual test files (like the old test-admin-status.ts if it's now covered by proper tests in tests/). Delete any other clearly obsolete or repetitive scripts.
Keep Operational Scripts: Keep the useful setup, utility, dev, and deployment scripts directly in scripts/.
Create scripts/lib/ (Optional but Recommended): Create a scripts/lib/ subfolder only for shared code used by multiple operational scripts within the scripts/ folder.
Move load-env.ts into scripts/lib/env-loader.ts.
Consider creating shared Supabase utilities in scripts/lib/ if needed.
Document: Create or update scripts/README.md to list the remaining scripts and explain their purpose and usage.
This approach keeps your operational scripts separate, allows for some code reuse via scripts/lib/, and relies on clear documentation rather than forcing an unnecessary rigid structure or parent file.
