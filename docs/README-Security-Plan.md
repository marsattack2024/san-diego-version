   - **Assessment**: Critical to verify before deployment
   - **MVP Approach**: 
     - Audit all API routes to ensure authentication checks
     - Verify middleware is protecting sensitive routes
     - Add validation for all input parameters

### High Priority for MVP

1. **Content Security Policy** ✅
   - **Current**: Comprehensive CSP implemented in next.config.mjs
   - **Assessment**: Well-configured with appropriate restrictions
   - **Implementation**: 
     ```js
     // Implemented in next.config.mjs
     {
       key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
       value: "default-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://api.openai.com; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https://*.supabase.co https://avatar.vercel.sh;"
     }
     ```
   - **Additional Headers**: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection

2. **Rate Limiting** ✅
   - **Current**: Implemented edge middleware rate limiting with different tiers for different endpoints
   - **Assessment**: Good implementation for API protection with appropriate limits
   - **MVP Approach**: ✅ Implemented with in-memory solution:
     - Tiered rate limits for different endpoint types (auth, general API, AI)
     - Proper headers and response codes for rate-limited requests
     - Extensible design for future improvements with Redis or similar
     - Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Medium Priority for MVP

1. **Server-Side Validation** ⚠️
   - **Current**: Inconsistent implementation across endpoints
   - **Assessment**: Important but can be implemented incrementally
   - **MVP Approach**: 
     - Focus on validating critical endpoints first (authentication, user data)
     - Use simple validation patterns initially
     - Add Zod incrementally to new endpoints
     - Create a validation utility for common data types

2. **CORS Configuration** ⚠️
   - **Current**: Basic headers but no comprehensive policy
   - **Assessment**: Important if you have external clients
   - **MVP Approach**: Implement basic CORS for known origins:
     ```js
     // Basic CORS config for MVP
     res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGIN || 'https://yourdomain.com');
     res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE');
     res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
     ```

3. **TypeScript Security** ✅
   - **Current**: TypeScript is configured with strict mode enabled
   - **Assessment**: Good configuration for preventing runtime errors
   - **Implementation**: tsconfig.json has `"strict": true` set
   - **MVP Approach**:
     - Continue using strict mode
     - Replace any remaining `any` types with proper interfaces
     - Add type guards for data coming from external sources

4. **Client-Side Storage** ⚠️
   - **Current**: Several instances of localStorage usage for non-sensitive data
   - **Assessment**: Current implementation is acceptable for MVP but could be improved
   - **Found In**:
     - `lib/agents/core/agent-context.ts`: Stores agent context in localStorage
     - `stores/chat-store.ts`: Chat persistence in localStorage
     - `components/multimodal-input.tsx`: Input state persistence
   - **MVP Approach**:
     - Maintain current implementation for non-sensitive data
     - Ensure no sensitive data (tokens, personal info) is stored in client storage
     - Add safeguards for potential XSS issues (consider encrypted storage post-MVP)

5. **Linter Errors** ⚠️
   - **Current**: ESLint configured but checks bypassed during build
   - **Assessment**: Important for code quality but can be addressed gradually
   - **MVP Approach**: 
     - Fix high-priority errors (security, accessibility)
     - Keep build ignore flags until MVP stabilizes
     - Add pre-commit hooks for new code only

### Low Priority for MVP (Can Wait for Post-MVP)

1. **Dependency Management** ⚠️
   - **Current**: No automated auditing
   - **MVP Approach**: Run manual `npm audit` periodically instead of setting up automated systems

2. **Monitoring & Alerts** ⚠️
   - **Current**: Basic logging without alerts
   - **MVP Approach**: Continue with current logging; add basic error alerting if resources allow

3. **File Uploads** ⚠️
   - **Current**: No clear implementation
   - **MVP Approach**: Defer to post-MVP if file uploads aren't core functionality

4. **Incident Response Plan** ❌
   - **Current**: Not implemented
   - **MVP Approach**: Create a simple template with basic incident handling steps rather than a comprehensive plan

## Vercel Deployment Security Checklist

Before deploying to Vercel, verify these critical security items:

### Essential Checks (Must Complete)
