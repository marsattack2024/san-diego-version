# Testing Summary

## ESM Migration Testing

We've successfully completed the ESM migration and verified that the application is working correctly. Here's a summary of the tests we've performed:

### Configuration Verification

- ✅ Verified `tsconfig.json` settings:
  - `"module": "ESNext"`
  - `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`
  - `"target": "ES2020"`
  - Proper path aliases configuration

- ✅ Verified `package.json` settings:
  - `"type": "module"` is correctly set
  - Scripts are properly configured

- ✅ Verified `next.config.mjs` settings:
  - ESM-compatible configuration
  - Experimental features enabled

### Build and Runtime Testing

- ✅ Successfully ran ESLint checks
  - Some linting issues were identified but they don't affect the build
  
- ✅ Successfully built the application with `npm run build`
  - All routes were generated correctly
  - No critical errors were encountered

- ✅ Successfully started the development server with `npm run dev`
  - Server starts without errors
  - All routes are accessible

- ✅ Verified the enhanced-chat page is accessible
  - Returns 200 OK status
  - Page loads correctly

### Utility Scripts Testing

- ✅ Created and tested `test-scraper.js`
  - Successfully scrapes content from example.com and developer.mozilla.org
  - Extracts title, description, and main content

- ✅ Created and tested `test-perplexity.js`
  - Successfully connects to the Perplexity API
  - Performs both regular and streaming API calls
  - Properly handles API key from .env.local

- ✅ Created documentation for scripts in `scripts/README.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Address remaining ESLint warnings
   - Refactor code to follow ESM best practices

2. **Directory Structure Consolidation**
   - Move all code to either the root or `src` directory
   - Update imports accordingly

3. **Testing Enhancements**
   - Add automated tests for ESM compatibility
   - Create integration tests for key features

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update project documentation with ESM migration details
   - Document best practices for future development

## Conclusion

The ESM migration has been successfully completed and verified. The application is now running with ECMAScript Modules, and all critical functionality is working correctly. The test scripts we've created will help with future development and testing.
