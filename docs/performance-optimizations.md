# Performance Optimizations

## Vote API Consolidation

### Problem

The application was making frequent redundant API calls to `/api/vote?chatId=...` to fetch vote data, even though that data was already available in the chat messages. This caused:

1. Unnecessary network requests
2. Extra server load
3. Potential 401 errors when auth tokens expired

### Solution

We consolidated the data flow by:

1. **Removed the GET endpoint from the vote API**: Since votes are stored directly in the `sd_chat_histories` table as a `vote` column, there's no need for a separate endpoint to fetch this data.

2. **Reused chat data for votes**: The `/api/chat/[id]` endpoint already includes vote information in each message's data. We modified the frontend to extract vote data directly from messages instead of making separate API calls.

3. **Optimistic UI updates**: When a user votes, we optimistically update the chat data in the SWR cache, providing immediate feedback while the vote is processed in the background.

### Implementation Details

1. **Chat Component**: 
   - Removed separate SWR call for votes
   - Added a `processedVotes` function to extract vote data from chat messages

2. **Message-Actions Component**:
   - Updated vote handlers to mutate the chat data directly
   - Eliminated redundant SWR cache updates

3. **Vote API**:
   - Removed the GET endpoint
   - Kept the POST endpoint for submitting votes
   - Simplified error handling

### Benefits

1. **Reduced API calls**: Eliminated all GET requests to `/api/vote`
2. **Improved performance**: Fewer network requests, faster UI
3. **Better user experience**: Vote status is immediately available with chat data
4. **Reduced auth errors**: Fewer opportunities for 401 errors when auth tokens expire

### Future Improvements

1. Consider using WebSockets for real-time vote updates in collaborative scenarios
2. Add vote analytics tracking to understand user feedback patterns
