# Testing Status Report

## Overview
This document provides a current status of the test suite and outlines the improvements made to fix failing tests following the ESM migration.

## Fixed Test Files (31 tests total)

| Test File | Status | Tests | Notes |

| tests/unit/api/update-title-route.test.ts | ✅ | 10 | Fixed Response mocking |
| tests/unit/widget-chat/widget-chat-route.test.ts | ✅ | 5 | Already working |
| tests/unit/services/document-retrieval.test.ts | ✅ | 9 | Fixed logger THRESHOLDS mocking |

## Partially Fixed Test Files (3 of 5 tests passing)

| Test File | Status | Tests | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| tests/unit/services/title-service.test.ts | ⚠️ | 3/5 | Issues with Supabase mocking |

## Test Files Needing Work (9 tests failing)

| Test File | Status | Tests | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| tests/unit/lib/cache/cache-service.test.ts | ❌ | 0/9 | Redis mocking needs update for current CacheService implementation |

## Recommendations

1. **Update Cache Service Tests**
   - Revise the Redis mock implementation to match the current CacheService implementation
   - Update expectations for log message formats to match current logging patterns
   - Ensure the mock maintains separation between keys for different cache namespaces

2. **Fix Title Service Tests**
   - Update Supabase client mocking to correctly handle the chain of method calls
   - Ensure the `maybeSingle` method returns data in the correct format
   - Add proper error handling in mock implementation

3. **Create Mock Client Factories**
   - Develop standardized mock factories for commonly mocked services (Redis, Supabase, etc.)
   - Implement these in a shared testing utilities directory
   - Include configuration options to handle different test scenarios

4. **Extend Testing Documentation**
   - Add more examples of properly mocked services
   - Document patterns for testing different types of components
   - Include troubleshooting guide for common testing issues

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining test fixes for title-service.test.ts
2. Update the Redis mocking approach for cache-service.test.ts
3. Run the complete test suite to identify any other failing tests
4. Document all mocking approaches in a central testing guide
5. Consider implementing automated test verification as part of the PR process

## Test Environment Improvements

During the test fixing process, several key improvements were made to the testing environment:

1. **Enhanced Mock Logger**
   - Added missing constants (THRESHOLDS) to the mock logger setup
   - Implemented helper methods for finding logs with specific content

2. **Fixed Response Object Mocking**
   - Ensured all mock responses include proper status codes and methods
   - Standardized approach to Response object creation in tests

3. **Improved AI SDK Mocking**
   - Created comprehensive mocks for the AI SDK
   - Fixed issues with missing './stream' module specifier

4. **Proper Fetch Mocking**
   - Implemented vi.stubGlobal approach for fetch mocking
   - Ensured mock responses include all required methods

These improvements have been documented in the new testing guide to ensure consistent implementation across the codebase.
