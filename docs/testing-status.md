# Testing Status Report

## Overview
This document provides a current status of the test suite and outlines the improvements made to fix failing tests following the ESM migration.

| tests/unit/chat-engine/tools-used-persistence.test.ts | ✅ | 3 | Fixed MessagePersistenceService mocking |
| tests/unit/services/title-service.test.ts | ✅ | 5 | Fixed Supabase client mocking |
| tests/unit/lib/cache/cache-service.test.ts | ✅ | 1 | Placeholder test; needs full implementation |

## Test Files Needing Complete Implementation

| Test File | Status | Tests | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| tests/unit/lib/cache/cache-service.test.ts | ⚠️ | 1/9 | Placeholder implemented. Requires dedicated work to properly mock Redis with ESM modules |

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Full Cache Service Tests**
   - Use the guidance in the placeholder test to create a proper implementation
   - Consider using isolated tests instead of a shared Redis mock to avoid hoisting issues
   - Follow the patterns in testing-guide.md for proper Redis client mocking

2. **Create Mock Client Factories**
   - Develop standardized mock factories for commonly mocked services (Redis, Supabase, etc.)
   - Implement these in a shared testing utilities directory
   - Include configuration options to handle different test scenarios

3. **Extend Testing Documentation**
   - Add more examples of properly mocked services
   - Document patterns for testing different types of components
   - Include troubleshooting guide for common testing issues

## Next Steps

1. Complete the full implementation of cache-service tests using the approach outlined in testing-guide.md
2. Run the complete test suite to identify any other failing tests
3. Document all mocking approaches in a central testing guide
4. Consider implementing automated test verification as part of the PR process

## Test Environment Improvements

During the test fixing process, several key improvements were made to the testing environment:

1. **Enhanced Mock Logger**
   - Added missing constants (THRESHOLDS) to the mock logger setup
   - Implemented helper methods for finding logs with specific content
   - Added hasLogsMatching method for flexible log assertion

2. **Fixed Response Object Mocking**
   - Ensured all mock responses include proper status codes and methods
   - Standardized approach to Response object creation in tests

3. **Improved AI SDK Mocking**
   - Created comprehensive mocks for the AI SDK
   - Fixed issues with missing './stream' module specifier

4. **Proper Fetch Mocking**
   - Implemented vi.stubGlobal approach for fetch mocking
   - Ensured mock responses include all required methods

5. **Type-Safe Mocking**
   - Added type assertions to properly handle TypeScript constraints
   - Fixed issues with mocked Supabase client type compatibility

These improvements have been documented in the new testing guide to ensure consistent implementation across the codebase.
