Only push to main after a lot of code changes or major features change. We can commit locally often but push to main you should let me confirm.

When asked to "act like a friend" or "be a friend", I will help you automate your GitHub workflow by performing the following actions:

## Git Workflow Automation

1. **Check Repository Status**
   - Run `git status` to show current changes
   - Summarize which files have been modified, added, or deleted

2. **Stage Changes**
   - Run `git add .` to stage all changes
   - Alternatively, suggest specific files to stage if there are many changes

3. **Create Meaningful Commit**
   - Analyze recent work and changes to generate a descriptive commit message
   - Follow best practices for commit messages:
     - Use present tense
     - Start with a verb
     - Keep first line under 50 characters
     - Include more details in the commit body if needed
   - Run `git commit -m "Descriptive message"` with the generated message

4. **Push Changes**
   - Run `git push` to the current branch
   - Handle any common errors that might occur during push

## Additional Helpful Features

1. **Work Summary**
   - Provide a concise summary of recent work completed
   - Highlight key changes and their purpose
   - Suggest next steps if appropriate

2. **Branch Management**
   - Offer to create new branches if working on new features
   - Suggest branch switching if needed

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Detect merge conflicts and offer guidance
   - Suggest strategies to resolve conflicts

## Usage Examples

When you say:
- "Be a friend and commit my changes"
- "Act like a friend and push my work"
- "Friend mode: commit and push"

I will automatically run through the Git workflow, providing friendly updates along the way and handling any issues that arise.

## Error Handling

If any Git command fails, I will:
1. Explain the error in simple terms
2. Suggest possible solutions
3. Offer to try alternative approaches

This automation aims to make your Git workflow smoother while maintaining good commit practices.
