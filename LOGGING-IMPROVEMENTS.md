# AI SDK Logging Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the logging implementation for AI components and the Vercel AI SDK integration in our application.

## Server-Side Improvements

### Enhanced API Route Logging (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)

1. **Token Usage Tracking**
   - Added detailed token estimation for both prompt and completion
   - Implemented cost calculation based on model type
   - Created a dedicated `logTokenUsage` function to standardize token logging

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error categorization based on error message patterns
   - Added specific logging for different error types (rate limits, authentication, invalid requests)
   - Enhanced error responses with appropriate status codes and detailed messages

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Added stream analytics logging to track stream duration
   - Implemented response time tracking in headers
   - Added request ID tracking for correlation across logs

## Client-Side Improvements

### Enhanced Chat Component (`components/chat/enhanced-chat.tsx`)

1. **Accessibility Logging**
   - Added focus tracking for screen readers
   - Implemented logging for user interactions with the chat interface
   - Enhanced error logging with detailed context

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added business event logging for errors
   - Enhanced error context with stack traces and error names
   - Improved error recovery with better user feedback

### Enhanced Chat Hook (`hooks/useEnhancedChat.ts`)

1. **Performance Tracking**
   - Added completion time tracking for AI responses
   - Implemented API call time measurement
   - Enhanced message sending with performance metrics

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error context with detailed information
   - Added error status tracking for messages
   - Enhanced error propagation with proper logging

### Business Event Logging (`src/utils/client-logger.ts`)

1. **New Error Event**
   - Added `errorOccurred` business event to track user-facing errors
   - Enhanced context for error events with user ID, agent type, and URL
   - Implemented standardized error logging format

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**
   - More context in logs makes it easier to diagnose issues
   - Correlation between client and server logs through request IDs
   - Detailed error information helps identify root causes

2. **Performance Insights**
   - Token usage tracking helps optimize costs
   - Response time metrics help identify bottlenecks
   - Stream analytics provide insights into AI model performance

3. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Focus tracking helps ensure the application is accessible
   - Screen reader interaction logging helps identify usability issues
   - Better error handling improves the experience for all users

4. **Business Intelligence**
   - Error tracking helps identify common user issues
   - Performance metrics help optimize the application
   - Token usage tracking helps manage costs

## Future Improvements

1. **Real-time Token Tracking**
   - Implement more accurate token counting using tokenizer libraries
   - Add token usage visualization for administrators

2. **Enhanced Stream Analytics**
   - Implement time-to-first-token tracking
   - Add tokens-per-second metrics for performance optimization

3. **A/B Testing Integration**
   - Add experiment tracking to logs
   - Implement variant tracking for different AI models or prompts

4. **User Session Analytics**
   - Track session duration and engagement metrics
   - Implement user journey logging to understand usage patterns
